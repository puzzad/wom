# Puzzad's Wise Old Man

Every adventurer needs a Wise Old Man to guide them. WOM is a small backend
service that performs a number of useful functions for Puzzad that can't be
done client-side or within the database:

- Generates and validates captchas
- Sends e-mail in response to contact/support/feedback forms
- Accepts mailing list signups and unsubscribe requests
- Manages payment workflows
